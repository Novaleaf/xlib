# A monolithic, cross-platform library.  (Browser+Node)
*Kitchen sink included.*

-----
# Status: UNSTABLE, Active Development
**Do not** use this library for the time being.  It is under active development and the structure will change as I figure out how to publish reusable typescript libraries.


#Usage Requirements

##Node.JS:
1. Can be used as is.  Tested with Node.js v6.0.0

##Browser:
1. Requires Browserify, or similar node core module conversions to use some components.  may mostly work without browserify, but not tested.
2. Modern Browser is assumed.  Has been tested with IE 9 though, and it works.

##Typescript:
1. This is coded in Typescript is usable without any 3rd party typings installed.
