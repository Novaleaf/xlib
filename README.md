# A curated collection of 3rd party libraries and commonly useful functions.  Cross Platform.
*Best used with Typescript 2.x*

**```Xlib```** is Typescript's answer to .Net's Core Library.  It is not a translation of ```mscorlib```, but rather a collection of functions and features you'll use every day in your JavaScript code.

--------
# 4.x Status: works!



**xlib** has been used as the BCL (base class libary) for high quality production systems
including [PhantomJs Cloud](https://PhantomJsCloud.com).


This 4.x release has been refactored for use with WebPack, and has been tested with it.


## Designed for
- **Browser**: Chrome.  works in all browsers (IE9+) via Browserify/Webpack, but the ```logging``` output is most pretty in Chrome.  Tested with WebPack.
- **Node**: Tested with 0.12 to 6.0.0
- **Typescript**: xlib is written in Typescript, and designed with it in mind.

## Use with Typescript (intellisense typings)

To use xlib with typescript intellisence you will need to do the following:

1. *use Typescript 2.x*
2. ```npm install xlib```

## Why

Since I started programming, I've a big fan of the .NET Framework.  Xlib is my attempt to bring that level of great features + usability to the Javascript (and Typescript!) world.
